            <p>
                My name is Boi. I live in the Netherlands. On this site
            you can see a couple of projects of mine, on my github you can see (almost) everything i've made.
            I am a game developer and make most of my projects in Unity.
            I also have some experience with Unreal. My favorite programming language is C# mainly because 
            It's the first real language I learned.
            But I want to do more with C++ because from what i've heard and seen you have
            more control over everything.
            I am very interested in open source, older technology
            and video games. Some of the games I play are rimworld, guilty gear and age of empires.
            In my free time I mainly program or play games.
            I would like to get an intership at a place where I can learn a lot about programming, git and how to work in a team.
            </p>
